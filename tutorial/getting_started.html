<h1>Getting Started with ChromeVox on your Chrome OS Netbook</h1>
<p>When you open your Chrome OS Netbook, type Control-Alt-Z to turn on accessibility. This turns
your Netbook into a self-voicing browser with a rich set of keyboard navigation options. The
Control-Alt-Z key sequence is a toggle switch; it turns accessibility on if it is currently off, and
turns it off if it is currently on. Enabling accessibility activates ChromeVox, the built-in
accessibility tool that provides spoken feedback in your browser.</p>

<p>When accessibility is enabled, you can use Tab to go through selectable items such as links and
buttons; press Enter to select the current item. You use the arrow keys for basic navigation through
text; however,there are a lot of additional navigation options, which we will go into after getting
set up.</p>

<h2>Configuring your Netbook</h2>
<p>The first time you open your Chrome OS Netbook and turn on accessibility, you must go through
some configuration screens. You will not have to do this again; the next time you open your Netbook,
it will automatically use the configuration details you set up.</p>
<ul>
    <li>Network and license agreement</li>
    <p>The first option is to choose your language, but ChromeVox is only available for US English
    currently, so you can skip that. You do have to choose a network. When you have selected your
    network, choose Continue.</p>

    <p>You must accept the License Agreement, and choose Continue to set up your user
    information.</p>

    <li>User information</li>
    <p>If you have a Google account, enter your email address (such as me@gmail.com) and password.
    After you set this up, you will only need to enter your password.</p>

    <p>If you do not have a Google account, you can choose to Browse as Guest, or to create a
    Google account.</p>

    <li>Picture</li>
    <p>The final set up screen offers to take your picture for your user profile. You can choose to
    take the picture and choose OK to continue, or skip it.</p>
</ul>

<p>That’s it. Your browser goes immediately to the Getting Started page. Next time you open your
Netbook, you just enter  your password (if you are using a Google account), and you are ready to
browse.</p>

<h2>Configuring your Browser</h2>
<p>Now that you are in the browser, type Alt to open the Chromium system menu. You can navigate
through this menu using the up and down arrows to choose configuration options, such as your
preferred home page. Some of the options open new tabs in the browser, which allow you to set up
more complicated preferences.</p>

<h2>Browsing with ChromeVox</h2>
<p>The browser beeps when a page has finished loading and is ready for you to navigate.</p>

<ul>
    <li>Use the Tab key to navigate through selectable items such as links, tabs, and command
    buttons. When you reach the item you want to select, press Enter.</li>
    <li>To navigate through the text on a screen, you can use the ChromeVox modifier keys Shift
    and Search with the arrow keys to navigate through the page, or you can execute additional
    more specific navigation commands.</li>
</ul>

<p>At any time, you can press the Control key to stop the current speech.</p>

<h3>Navigation commands</h3>
<p>ChromeVox provides a rich set of navigation commands. To enter a command, hold down the ChromeVox
modifier keys Shift and Search while you enter the key or key sequence for that command. For
example, the key sequence Shift + Search + N + H goes to the Next Heading.</p>

<h3>Text levels</h3>
<p>Shift and Search plus the up or down arrows move you to the next or previous level of text. Use
    the forward and back arrows to select the level of navigation detail. At higher levels, you can
    skip details, and quickly get to the part of the page you are interested in. Levels range from
    groups (for example, an entire bulleted list), down to individual characters.</p>
<p>The levels are:
<ul>
    <li>groups</li>
    <li>objects (for instance, bullet points)</li>
    <li>sentences</li>
    <li>words</li>
    <li>characters</li>
</ul></p>

<h3>Sticky mode</h3>
<p>If you don’t want to hold down the Shift and Search keys for a sequence of commands, you can use
“sticky mode”. Press Search twice to enter sticky mode; now all of your key presses are interpreted
as ChromeVox commands, until you exit sticky mode by pressing Search twice again.</p>

<h3>Command help</h3>
<p>The period is the command for ChromeVox help. Hold down the Shift and Search keys and press
period to begin browser through a list of available ChromeVox command sequences. There are two
ways to use the command help:</p>

<ul>
    <li>You can navigate through this list with the up and down arrows.</li>
    <li>You can search through commands by typing. The list is filtered to present commands that
    match what you type. You can type match characters in any order; for example, if you search for
    “next h” or “head n”, you will get to the Next Heading command.</li>
</ul>


<p>You can press Shift and Search at any time to exit the help menu.</p>

<h3>User Guide</h3>
<p>Press the key sequence Shift + Search + H to open the ChromeVox User Guide. The guide
contains information on how to get started with ChromeVox, a full list of keyboard shortcuts,
and an interactive ChromeVox tutorial.</p>

<h3>Keyboard Explorer</h3>
<p>Pressing the key sequence Shift + Search + O + K opens the ChromeVox Keyboard Explorer. You can
use the Keyboard Explorer to locate and learn about the keys on your keyboard. When the Keyboard
Explorer is open, press any key on your keyboard to hear what that key is called. To close the
Keyboard Explorer, press Control + W. Unfortunately, there are a few keys that the Keyboard Explorer
does not recognize. Those keys are:
<ul>
    <li>Reload - the Reload key is located four keys from the left on the top row of keys. It's
        above the number 4 key.</li>
    <li>Full Screen - the key to toggle Full Screen mode is located five keys from the left on
        the top row of keys. It's above the number 5 key.</li>
    <li>Next Window - the key to switch to the next browser window is located six keys from the left
        on the top row of keys. It's above the number 6 key.</li>
    <li>Decrease Brightness - the key to decrease the brightness of the screen is located six keys
        from the right on the top row of keys. It's located between the number 7 and number 8 keys,
        one row above.</li>
    <li>Increase Brightness - the key to increase the brightness of the screen is located five keys
        from the right on the top row of keys. It's located between the number 8 and number 9 keys,
        one row above.</li>
    <li>Mute - the key to mute the volume is located four keys from the right on the top row of
        keys. It's above the number 0 key.</li>
    <li>Volume Down - the key to lower the volume is located three keys from the right on the top
        row of keys. It's above the dash key. Please note that you can lower the volume of ChromeVox
        speech independently by pressing Shift + Search + Open Bracket</li>
    <li>Volume Up - the key to raise the volume is located two keys from the right on the top row
        of keys. It's above the equal sign key. Please note that you can increase the volume of
        ChromeVox speech independently by pressing Shift + Search + Close Bracket</li>
    <li>Search - the Search key is located where you'd find the Caps Lock key on a traditional
        keyboard, above the Shift key and below the Tab key. Press it to open a new tab with focus
        in the Omnibox so you can do a quick web search. If you'd like the Caps Lock key back, you
        can change this key inside the System section of the Settings.</li>
    <li>Control - there are two Control keys on the Chrome OS keyboard. The first one is the
        left-most key on the bottom row, below the Shift key. The second one is on the right side of
        the keyboard, also on the bottom row, between the Alt key and the left arrow key.</li>
<ul>

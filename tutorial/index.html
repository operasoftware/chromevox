  <h1>ChromeVox User Guide</h1>
  <p>
    Welcome to ChromeVox!
  </p>
  <p>
    ChromeVox is a screen reader for Chrome OS, intended to bring the speed, versatility, and
    security of Chrome OS to visually impaired users. Because ChromeVox is built by Google, it's
    optimized for the web. It supports the latest web standards and excels at accessing the most
    modern interactive websites.
  </p>
  <p>
    The following are a few resources to help you start using ChromeVox. Because ChromeVox (and
    Chrome OS) is still a work in progress, expect these pages to change as ChromeVox evolves.
  <ul>

        <p>
        <a href="getting_started.html">Getting started with ChromeVox.</a>
        This guide walks you through the first steps of getting started with ChromeVox and Chrome
        OS, from the first time you open your Chrome OS device. Though ChromeVox can be enabled right
        away, there are a few steps to the configuration process and so we recommend that you keep
        this Getting Started guide handy.

        <a href="keyboard_shortcuts.html">Keyboard Shortcuts Reference Page.</a>
        This page lists all of the ChromeVox keyboard shortcuts for your reference. Though ChromeVox
        includes an interactive command lookup feature, this reference page keeps them all in one
        place.

    <h2>Moving around tables.</h2>
    <p>
        Now that you know the basics of navigating around a page with ChromeVox, we want to
        start introducing some features of ChromeVox that make it easier to perform more complex
        navigation. We'll start with table navigation.
    </p>
    <p>
        ChromeVox's table navigation mode gives you the ability to explore structured data quickly
        at a high level. You can think of it as new navigation method that allows you to move to
        each cell in a table individually. Furthermore, table mode cooperates with navigation at
        other granularities. While table navigation is active you can still zoom in to different
        granularities to view the contents of your current cell in different ways. So if you use
        table mode to move to a cell that contains text with multiple links, you can use the object
        level to quickly move around the links that are within that cell. You can then use table
        mode to move to a different cell and explore that one.
    </p>
    <p>
        ChromeVox will announce when you have entered a table by speaking "Table". Then, to activate
        table navigation mode press the ChromeVox keys, tap the letter T, and then the letter E.
        The ChromeVox keys and the letter T are always the keys you will press to start a table
        command. You can activate table navigation mode anywhere inside a table.
    </p>
    <p>
        To move between cells, use the following commands:
        <ul>
            <li>ChromeVox + T + I for the cell above the current cell</li>
            <li>ChromeVox + T + M for the cell below the current cell</li>
            <li>ChromeVox + T + J for the cell to the left of the current cell</li>
            <li>ChromeVox + T + K for the cell to the right of the current cell</li>
        </ul>
    </p>
    <p>
        To leave table navigation mode to explore the rest of the page, press ChromeVox + T +
        Delete. That command will jump you out of the table to the content immediately
        following the table on the page.
    </p>
    <p>
        Try navigating through the simple table following this paragraph using the commands listed
        earlier to move between cells. Remember, you can press ChromeVox + T + Delete at any time
        to leave table mode.

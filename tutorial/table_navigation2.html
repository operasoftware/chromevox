    <h2>More Techniques for Table Navigation.</h2>
    <p>
        This section will teach you some more techniques to navigate large tables efficiently.
    </p>
    <p>
        Anytime you're in table navigation mode, you can request information about your current
        location inside the table by pressing ChromeVox + T + L. This command will tell you your
        current row and column, as well as the total number of rows and columns in the table. Also,
        right after you enter a table, ChromeVox will announce the number of rows and columns
        in the table.
    </p>
    <p>
        You can also request to hear the row and column headers of the current cell (if there are
        any) by pressing ChromeVox + T + H. You can request the row and column headers individually
        by pressing ChromeVox + T + R for row headers and ChromeVox + T + C. If there aren't any
        row or column headers provided, ChromeVox will make a "best guess" as to what they should
        be when you request them individually using ChromeVox + T + R or ChromeVox + T + C.
    </p>
    <p>
        There are also several ChromeVox commands that enable you to jump to different cells inside
        of a table:
        <uL>
          <li>ChromeVox + T + Left Brace jumps to the first cell of the table.</li>
          <li>ChromeVox + T + Right Brace jumps to the last cell of the table.</li>
          <li>ChromeVox + T + Semicolon will jump to the first cell of your current row.</li>
          <li>ChromeVox + T + Apostrophe will jump to the last cell of your current row.</li>
          <li>ChromeVox + T + Comma will jump to the first cell of your current column.</li>
          <li>ChromeVox + T + Period will jump to the last cell of your current column.</li>
        </ul>
    </p>
    <p>
        Here's another challenge for you: following this paragraph is a very large table with a lot
        of cells. Each cell you enter will contain directions you must follow in order to make it
        to the end of the table and advance to the next section. If you get lost, press ChromeVox + 
        T + Left Bracket to go back to the beginning and try again. Or, click on the "Skip exercise"
        link if you want to continue to the next section without playing the challenge.

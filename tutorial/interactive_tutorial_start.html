  <p>
    Welcome to web browsing with ChromeVox. ChromeVox enables you to use your keyboard
    to explore the web with the help of a text-to-speech engine. ChromeVox will read
    to you as you navigate through the web. Let's jump right in with some basics that
    you will need to read this tutorial. Press and hold the Shift and Search keys, then tap the down
    arrow to continue.
  </p>
  <p>
    ChromeVox lets you move across groups on a page. You landed on this piece of text
    by pressing the ChromeVox modifier keys Shift and Search with the down arrow.
    You can move back a group by holding the ChromeVox modifiers and tapping up.  We will shorten
    our description of commands of this type by saying "ChromeVox down" and "ChromeVox up".  Press
    ChromeVox down to continue.
  </p>
  <p>
    Think of this as "tabbing", but instead of only reaching certain objects, you can reach all
    groups on a web page.  This includes text, groups of links, and other elements.  Press ChromeVox
    down to read the next group.
  </p>
  <p>
    The tutorial is structured in such a way that you can move to the next topic or idea by pressing
    ChromeVox with down. In this way, you can "rewind" or repeat previous discussions if you want to
    go over it again or if you didn't quite understand it. This tutorial also breaks up major topics
    into separate pages, so you won't have to worry much about keeping track of where you are.
  </p>
  <p>
    One more thing before we continue. You can activate an object by pressing enter. Once you feel
    comfortable with the ChromeVox down and ChromeVox up commands, continue to the link and press
    enter.
